# TicketGO

This was my school final project.

This was a group project with me and 2 other people. My tasks were to create Frontend and create and manage middleware & DB with one more guy.</br>

TicketGO was a system with 3 main products - Frontend (Web), Backend (Admin) and mobile (Android) applications. The product must be used for ticket sales which will make it possible for the individual venues / festivals to sell tickets to their guests. The product's database, which is MongoDB, is stored in the cloud using MongoDB Atlas and middleware for data management is MongoDB Realm service with sends .

### System requirements were: </br>

SPA page which will inform and guide to the app.
* Splash page
* Contact
* Support / FAQ
* Terms & Privacy </br>
<b>Extras: </b>
* Login
* User profile / User Creation
* Darkmode
* Multilanguage
* Animations 

This website was made in React JS and I added small animations/motions to some elements with the help of <b>framer-motion</b> package and <b>intlt</b> for multilanguage support. Also I made a darkmode which users can toggle (and language) in the header. Also I tried to make it responsive for it to look good also in mobile devices.
